   abstract = {This study outlines the profile of research productivity grant holders of the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)] in the field of pediatric dentistry. A cross-sectional study with data collected from the Brazilian academic curriculum vitae database. The eligibility criterion was being a research productivity grant holder in pediatric dentistry from 2018 to 2020. In the period of interest, 215 individuals were research productivity grant holders in the field of dentistry, 33 of whom had graduate degrees (specialization, master's or doctorate) in pediatric dentistry. The period of scientific production and work concluded of advising of scientific initiation, master, doctoral and post-doctoral degrees was 2010 to 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze associations (5% significance level) between productivity grant level (2, 1D, 1C, 1B or 1A) and year of obtainment of the doctoral degree. The VOSviewer (version 1.6.17) was used to present graphically the interinstitutional collaborations. The sample was composed of Level 2 researchers (66.7%), women (66.7%), researchers linked to institutions in the southeastern region of Brazil (81.8%), with a doctoral degree concluded prior to 2002 (51.5%), began working as a professor at a higher education institution prior to 2007 (78.8%) and the title of full professor (45.5%). No significant association was found between productivity grant level and year of conclusion of the doctoral degree (p = 0.10). Median (interquartile range) of scientific articles was 119 (37-312). The prevalence of citations (57.52%) and JCR articles (62.76%) was higher among female researchers. In conclusion, CNPq research productivity grant holders in pediatric dentistry are essentially represented by females from the southeast region of the country (UFMG and USP). However, males have proportionally greater productivity.</p>},
