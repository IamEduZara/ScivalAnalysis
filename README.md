# ScivalAnalysis
This repository contains the results, and the analysis of data accessed through Scival, to provide insights about research performance and benchmarks across countries and several universities. The raw data and the analysis platform are not provided. However, the information was retrieved in late 2022. My partner Farid S. Jácome Velasco and I concluded this work as a partial requirement of the Research Methodology Course at Tecnológico de Monterrey. Please consult the report Scival-Review.pdf to visualize the conducted analysis.

Abstract—Academic productivity and excellence are part of the
knowledge factor that impacts a country’s economy. Currently,
land, capital, and work are no longer the only ones determining
the country’s productivity. Scientific knowledge is the driving
force for the development of a society and impacts the life quality
of a nation’s citizens. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the
current scenario of Mexico in terms of academic productivity
and excellence compared with the top countries in this factor.
One of the current tendencies is the multidisciplinary research
teams to improve the generation of innovative value in the pool
of knowledge. Given that fact, the multidisciplinary published
articles, the citation counts, the relevant topics, and the published
article keywords were analyzed in this work.

Index Terms—Multidisciplinary, Research, Productivity,
Knowledge, Articles, Citations, Mexico, USA, China, UK,
Germany, Japan.
