# ScivalAnalysis
 This repository contains the results, and the analysis of data accessed through Scival, to provide insights about research performance and benchmarks across countries and several universities. The raw data and the analysis platform are not provided. However, the information was retrieved in late 2022. My partner Farid S. Jácome Velasco and I concluded this work as a partial requirement of the Research Methodology Course at Tecnológico de Monterrey
